	<a>Cloth bags Distribution </a>
	<p>The use of plastic bags is considered as.Cloth bags are stronger and can be used to carry weights.Durable and long-lasting, unlike plastic and paper bags, which are easily torn. Cloth bags can tolerate heat.Eco-Friendly Cloth bags are eco-friendly as they do not contribute to pollution and environmental degradation. Unlike plastic bags, which can take hundreds of years to decompose, cloth bags can be easily recycled or composted.Humanity’s relationship with plastic is rather schizophrenic,Reduction of Plastic Pollution: One of the primary reasons to use reusable shopping bags is to reduce plastic pollution. Single-use plastic bags contribute significantly to environmental degradation, as they often end up in landfills, waterways, and oceans, where they harm wildlife and ecosystems.Reusability Cloth bags are reusable, and this is perhaps the most significant advantage they have over plastic bags. Unlike plastic bags, which are only used once and then discarded, cloth bags can be used repeatedly for shopping and other purposes. This means that they reduce waste and the need for frequent replacement.</p>

	<a>Blood Donation Camp </a>
	<p>A blood donation occurs when a person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions.There are three main advantages derived from a mass donation camp. First the resources available with any voluntary agency in India are just not sufficient to sustain a mass awareness campaign round the year .However, a specific campaign can start about three weeks before a mass donation camp and can gradually build up into a crescendo through postering, outdoor hoardings, radio talks, TV. exposures and through the free coverage in the newspapers. The publicity generated leads to increased awareness in general. Secondly, mass camps have a demonstration effect. When one sees so many fellow human beings donating blood, he feels inadequate unless he also donates himself. This is the demonstration effect of peer pressure. The third benefit is that a number of big and’ small blood banks working side by side act as a technical workshop and activate the less active blood banks. This, of course, needs a competent technical supervision.</p>

	<a> Tree Plantation-Tree are Good</a>
	<p>Tree-planting is the process of transplanting tree seedlings,generally for forestry, land reclamation.Trees give off oxygen that we need to breathe. Trees reduce the amount of storm water runoff, which reduces erosion and pollution in our waterways and may reduce the effects of flooding. Many species of wildlife depend on trees for habitat. Trees provide food, protection, and homes for many birds and mammals.f more trees are planted, then the world's environment will become a safer place to live in. Tree plantation also reduces pollution, thus making the life of future generations secure.
    <p> Top 5 Benefits of Trees =</p>
    <p> 1. Energy Savings</p>
    <p> 2. Flood Protection and Lower Taxes</p>
    <p> 3. Added Property Value</p>
    <p> 4. Reduced Stress and Improved Health</p>
    <p> 5. Necessary Part of a Healthy Environment</p>
